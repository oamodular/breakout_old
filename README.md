# Breakout

A conduit from the USB on the rear of a module to the face of your modular setup. Breakout has a USB-A port on the rear that is routed to either the USB-A or USB-C port on the front. The rear also has three-pin connector for I2C that is exposed with a mini-TRS socket on the front.

Between you me and the sea, we designed this to accompany several upcoming firmware for Uncertainty but realized this could be useful for lots of people. Modules like Instruo Lubadh and o_C (most versions) have USB on them that can be brought to the surface of your system.

Breakout is USB 2. USB 3 speeds are not supported.
